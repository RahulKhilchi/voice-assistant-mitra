# Voice Assistant Mitra
A voice-controlled AI assistant that can open websites, play music, tell the time, fetch news headlines, and answer general queries using Google Gemini API.


## üîé Project Overview

This project is a **voice-activated personal assistant** named **Mitra** that combines speech recognition, text-to-speech, and generative AI to perform everyday tasks.  
It listens to voice commands, processes them, and responds with either actions (like opening apps/websites, fetching news, or playing music) or conversational replies using Google‚Äôs **Gemini AI**.  

### ‚ú® Key Capabilities
- üé§ **Speech Recognition**: Uses `speech_recognition` to capture and process spoken commands.  
- üîä **Voice Output**: Replies naturally using `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech.  
- üåê **Web Shortcuts**: Opens Google, YouTube, and other sites on command.  
- üéµ **Music Playback**: Plays songs from a predefined library.  
- üì∞ **News Headlines**: Fetches the latest India news via the **NewsAPI**.  
- ü§ñ **Conversational AI**: Leverages **Google Gemini API** for natural, AI-powered responses when no direct command is matched.  
- ‚è∞ **Utilities**: Tells the current time and performs simple assistant tasks.  

### üõ† Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **speech_recognition** (voice input)  
- **pyttsx3** (voice output)  
- **webbrowser** (to open sites)  
- **requests** (API calls for news)  
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**  
- **NewsAPI**  

This assistant demonstrates how to integrate **voice commands** with **AI-driven responses**, creating a lightweight but functional personal assistant you can extend with more skills.
